# Introducing Rust

---

# An overview

1. Why Rust
2. Memory safety with borrowing
3. Result and Option types
4. Pattern matching
5. All the other cool stuff

---

# Why Rust?

---

*Rust* is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

---

Very expressive, like in some functional languages

---

Zero cost abstraction

---

Has no garbage collection

---

Yet guarantees memory safety

---

Sure, concurrency is fine, thanks for asking

---

* No dangling pointers
* No garbage collection
* Zero cost abstraction
* Very expressive
* Strong base for stronger concurrency

---

# Memory safety with borrowing

---

Memory management was costly one way or another

---

Borrowing is like lending a (digital) book*

* With some extras

---

# Borrowing in a nutshell:
* Every pointer has one owner
* A pointer can be borrowed read-only by many readers
* A pointer can be borrowed mutably only once
* A pointer can be moved

It's by far the most important and hardest concept in Rust!

---

# Moving and copying
```rust
fn my_func(a: String) -> String {
  let x = “abc” + &a;
  x.to_string()
} // x is dropped here

fn main() {
  let z = {
    let y = “d”.to_string();
    my_func(y) // my_func now owner of y
    // let b = y panics!
  }  // y is dropped here
  println!(“{}”, z);
}
```

---

# Borrowing
```rust
fn my_func(a: &str) -> String {
  let x = “abc” + a;
  x.to_string()
}
fn main() {
  let x = “d”.to_string();
  my_func(&x);
  let y = &x; // Sure!
  // let y = x; Panic!
}
```

---

# Borrowing in a nutshell:
* Every pointer has one owner
* A pointer can be borrowed read-only by many readers
* A pointer can be borrowed mutably only once
* A pointer can be moved

---

Let's look at some more code!

```rust
// Ruby style iterators
(1..100).iter().map(|i| i * 2).collect();
// Immutable by default
let x = 1;
// x = x + 1 panic!
let mut y = 1;
y = y + 1

// Error and Option types
error_happy_function -> Result<value_type, error_type>
gamble -> Option<value_type>
```

---

# MONADS!

---

Result and Option are used in Rust for exception and nil handling

---

# Using an Option

```rust
fn first_room() -> Option<HotelRoom> {
  if hotel_rooms_left() {
    Some(pop_hotel_room())
  } else {
    None
  }
}
```

---

# Using a Result with pattern matching

```rust
fn divide(num: f64, denom: f64) -> Result<f64, &str> {
  match denom {
    0.0 => Error(“Division by zero”),
    _   => Ok(num / denom)
  }
}
```

---

Results and Option often form the core of your code. Many tools to make this super
elegant!

---

# Couple more cool things

* Because of borrowing, threads are memory safe
* Rust is compatible with any FFI library
* No lightweight threads (yet), but many solid concurrency primitives

---

Biggest rust project is Servo

# Thank you!

* Check out the free Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
* Rust meetups are held every couple months
* We are always interested in speakers and sponsors!
